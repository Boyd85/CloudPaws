# CloudPaws
CloudPaws Capstone 2019


CloudPaws is an electronic health record (EHR) for veterinarians to use in their daily working life.
This EHR will be the central point for all appointments/records/patient information/etc. From a Vet
standpoint there must be a spot where all of this is kept and communicated. My app will have a
scheduler for all appointments and will have ways to add new patients/review old patients/etc. This will
serve as their central hub for information.
